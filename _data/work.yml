  description: Dave Musgrove Blinds approached us with very little online presence, no brand and a basic website. We created a new band, website and more and continue work with them to this day to ensure their online presence is tip-top.

      title: Branding, Identity & Logo Design
      description:
        - As Dave Musgrove is a sole-trader, his customers deal with him directly whether it's in their initial contact, their home visits to choose style and colour options or the actual fitting of the blinds.
        - We felt that Dave's brand should reflect his indivual and personal approach. This is why we decided to use Dave himself as the core of the brand. By crating the character, and basing the rest of the brand on the colour and style of this character, we acheived our brief of ensuring Dave Musgrove Blinds was represented as local, honest and most of all - a real person.

      title: Sky Rocketed Digital Marketing
      description:
        - An early part of the process with Dave Musgrove Blinds was to create a strong online presence. Part of this was acheived by using Facebook, Twitter, Google+ (and more).
        - Using our unique and bespoke social media strategy, we got the ball rolling in the early days (February 2014) and are now super proud to say that Dave Musgrove Blinds currently has 7.5k+ followers on Twitter and acheives nearly 30% of his website traffic through his social media channels.

      title: Branding & Identity Implimentation
      description:
        - Once Dave Musgrove Blinds' brand was created, it was time to impliment it. We were lucky enough that Dave loved his brand and wanted to show it off here, there and everywhere.
        - As part of Dave's ongoing marketing package with us, we implimented his brand in, among other places; the company vehicle, various flyers and leaflets, company stationary - business cards, leterheads, invoice templates etc, company workwear - shirts, ties, jackets, sweaters etc and even a short video which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_I_6lXHwUE">here</a>.

  description: The team at Carrick Johnson Lettings tasked us with redesigning their website to produce a fresh visual style and generate more leads. We also continue to work with them on social-media, digital marketing and website optimisation.

      title: Website Overhaul
      description:
        - Carrick Johnson Lettings & Property Management needed a complete overhaul of their website. Their old site lacked focus and failed to impliment their brand.
        - Expandia were able to design an entirely new site that hit the mark. We implimented their current brand and colour scheme but also extended and massaged to fit what is now a fresh, yet fitting website. This one is visually, one of our favourite designs to date.

      title: Let's Get Some Leads
      description:
        - One of the primary goals for the new website was to gain more leads. These leads come in the form of submissions through the website form.
        - To ensure that as many users as possible converted into leads, we designed a new form and placed it right at the top of the site. The form encourages users to "Discover the value of [their] property with our free valuation service". Users then fill in the form and are contacted by a member of the team. By basing the design of the homepage around this form, we gave it prominence without it feeling overly pushy.
        - Combined with a second form which sits seamlessly at the bottom of each page, we acheived the brief of generating more leads and converting more visitors.
        - The approach we have used here is a great example of designing a website around it's core task. Something a template website will always struggle to do.

      title: A system the staff can actually use
      description:
        - The website needed the functionality to enable the staff to create and edit their property listings on the site.
        - We acheived this by creating a hand-crafted property management system, with Wordpress working for us in the background. The staff are able to login, create proprties using a number of pre-defined fields (property-type, town, price etc) then push the proprties to the the live site for their potential tennants to view.
        - The system needed to be simple enough for the staff to use yet complex enough to allow visitors to, for example; sort by price, see proprties on a map, search by post-code and many more features.
        - This is just one example of a system which adds to a traditional website structure. Systems like this this are not only a breeze for us, they're on of the most fun parts of our job, too!

  description: The SWARM guys felt the need for a website to showcase their work. We created a simple, clean website with the functionality for SWARM to add, remove, edit and delete their portfolio items at their leisure.

      title: Up there with the big boys
      description:
        - SWARM Associates are a London based marketing agency so their visual style and approach to their website needed to reflaect their position in the marketplace.
        - By working with SWARM's in-house team, we were able to create a visually stunning website that was simple enough to be fit for purpose.
        - SWARM tend not to work on the web so their needs were faily simple; "a website to showcase the prtfolio that also suits our position in the market". Extending the colour-scheme from their logo and using a revised typeface, we hit the nail on the head and delivered a simple, clean website that allowed their portfolio and showreel to flourish.

      title: Dynamic Category Filter
      description:
        - SWARM work in a number of business sectors. These sectors are reflected in their portfolio by listing each category and allowing users to filter the portfolio by category.
        - The SWARM team can easily set multiple catgories on each portfolio item. These categories are then displayed on the front-end and users can click a category to filter by that category.

      title: A Content Management System (CMS) without the pain of a CMS
      description:
        - There are many options for managing content online. Here at Expandia, we lean on a bespoke approach each time. There are multiple beninfits to this approach. The main one being reduced-clutter and a concise, manageable codebase. Using thrid party code to acheive something like this can work but it tends to be tough to manage and even more tough to update.
        - Using a hand-crafted portfolio management system, built on Wordpress, we enabled the SWARM guys to easily login, created, edite and remove portfolio items at their leisure. This approach reduces costs over-time by allowing them to make updates wthout having to employ a team to do it.

  - Digital Marketing
  img: moonbabies-expandia-torquay
  description: The guys at Moonbabies tasked us with generating more sales for them. Through the use of Google AdWords, various social-media campaigns and a whole load of data analysis, we were able to make this happen.
  studies:
    -
      title: Market Analysis & Data Driven Decisions
      description:
        - The first step to creating a digital marketing strategy for Moonbabies was to analise their website, their market, competition and current succeses and failures.
        - Using the knowledge we gained from this process, we created a strong social media and digital marketing strategy to increase their Google rankings, social-media profiles and ultimately, gain more visitors.

      title: Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)
      description:
        - A large part of Moonbabies success was down to their SEO. When Moonbabies engaged us, they had previously handled their SEO themselves. Whilst this was done to a good degree of success, the Moonbabies team simply did not have the time to manage their SEO to the level they needed to to be able to compete in their market.
        - Combining their Search Engine Optimisation strategy with their social-media marketing stragety allowed us to acheive some great results, whilst creating, scheduling and publishing content that felt totally natural to their exsisting followers and customers.

      title: Pay Per Click Management
      description:
        - Another part of Moonbabies marketing stragety was their pay per click campaign. We were able to help Moonbabies reduce their budget and increase their click through rate.
        - As part of an ongoing marketing campaign, we are happy to help with PPC (pay per click) campaigns. We have a good range of experience in this area and are always happy to help where we can.
