  description: Dave Musgrove Blinds approached us with very little online presence, no brand and a basic website. We created a new brand, website and more and continue work with them to this day to ensure their online presence is tip-top.

      title: Branding, Identity & Logo Design
      description:
        - As Dave Musgrove is a sole-trader, his customers deal with him directly whether it's in their initial contact, their home visits to choose style and colour options or the actual fitting of the blinds.
        - We felt that Dave's brand should reflect his individual and personal approach. This is why we decided to use Dave himself as the core element of the brand. By creating the character, and basing the rest of the brand on the colour and style of the character, we achieved our brief of ensuring Dave Musgrove Blinds was represented as real, honest and most of all - personable.

      title: Sky Rocketed Digital Marketing
      description:
        - An early part of the process with Dave Musgrove Blinds was to create a strong online presence. Part of this was achieved by using Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, Tumblr and more.
        - Using our unique, hand-crafted social media strategy, we got the ball rolling in the early days (February 2014) and are now super proud to say that Dave Musgrove Blinds currently has 7.5k+ followers on Twitter and achieves nearly 30% of his website traffic through his social media channels.

      title: Branding & Identity Implementation
      description:
        - Once the Dave Musgrove Blinds brand was created, it was time to implement it. We were lucky enough that Dave loved his brand and wanted to show it off here, there and everywhere.
        - As part of Dave's ongoing marketing package with us, we implemented his brand in, among other places; the company vehicle, various flyers and leaflets, company stationary - business cards, letterheads, invoice templates etc, company work wear - shirts, ties, jackets, sweaters etc and even a short video which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_I_6lXHwUE" class="bold">here</a>.

      title: Website Overhaul
      description:
        - Carrick Johnson Lettings & Property Management needed a complete overhaul of their website. Their old site lacked focus and failed to implement their brand.
        - Expandia were able to design an entirely new website that hit the mark. We implemented their current brand and colour scheme but also extended and massaged it to fit. The result was a fresh visual style but a wesbite that is still <i>on-brand</i>. Visually speaking, this is one of our favorite designs to date.

      title: Let's Get Some Leads
      description:
        - One of the primary goals for the new website was for it to produce more leads. These leads come in the form of submissions through the website form.
        - To ensure as many users as possible converted into leads, we designed a new form and placed it right at the top of the site. The form encourages users to "Discover the value of [their] property with [our] free valuation service". Users then fill in the form and are contacted by a member of the team. By basing the design of the homepage around this form, we gave it prominence without it feeling overly pushy.
        - Combined with a second form which sits seamlessly at the bottom of each page, we achieved the brief of generating more leads and converting more visitors.
        - The approach we used here is a great example of designing a website around it's core task. Something a templated website will always struggle to do.

      title: A system the staff can actually use
      description:
        - The website needed the functionality to allow staff to create and edit property listings.
        - We achieved this by creating a hand-crafted property management system, with Wordpress working for us in the background. The staff are able to login, create properties using a number of pre-defined fields (property-type, town, price etc) then push the properties to the the live site for their potential tenants to view.
        - The system needed to be simple enough for the staff to use yet complex enough to allow visitors to, for example; sort by price, see properties on a map, search by post-code and many more features.
        - This is just one example of a system which adds to a traditional website structure. Systems like this this are not only a breeze for us, they're one of the most fun parts of our job, too!

      # title: Up there with the big boys
      # description:
        # - SWARM Associates are a London based marketing agency so their visual style and approach to their website needed to reflect their position in the marketplace.
        # - By working with SWARM's in-house team, we were able to create a visually stunning website that was simple enough to fit its purpose.
        # - SWARM tend not to work on the web so their needs were fairly simple; "a website to showcase the portfolio that also suits our position in the market". Extending the colour scheme from their logo and using a revised typeface, we hit the nail on the head and delivered a simple, clean website that allowed their portfolio and showreel to flourish.

      # title: Dynamic Category Filter
      # description:
        # - SWARM offer a number of different services. These services are reflected in their portfolio by listing each as a category and allowing users to filter the portfolio by category.
        # - The SWARM team can easily set multiple categories on each portfolio item. These categories are then displayed on the front-end and users can click a category to filter by that category.

      # title: A Content Management System (CMS) without the pain of a CMS
      # description:
        # - There are many options for managing content online. Here at Expandia, we lean on a bespoke approach each time. There are multiple benefits to this approach. The main one being reduced-clutter and a concise, manageable codebase. Using third party code to achieve something like this can work but it tends to be tough to manage and even more tough to update.
        # - Using a hand-crafted portfolio management system, built on Wordpress, we enabled the SWARM guys to easily login, create, edit and remove portfolio items at their leisure. This approach reduces costs over-time by allowing them to make updates without having to employ a team like us just to make small changes.

  description: The guys at Moonbabies tasked us with generating more sales for them. Through the use of Google AdWords, various social-media campaigns and a whole load of data analysis, we were able to make this happen.
  studies:
    -
      title: Market Analysis & Data Driven Decisions
      description:
        - The first step to creating a digital marketing strategy for Moonbabies was to analyse their website, their market, competition and current successes and failures.
        - Using the knowledge we gained from this process we created a social media and digital marketing strategy that aimed to; increase Google rankings, achieve higher levels of success on social-media and to generate more sales.

      title: Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)
      description:
        - A large part of Moonbabies success was down to their SEO. When Moonbabies engaged us, they had previously handled their SEO themselves. Whilst this achieved a respectable degree of success, the Moonbabies team simply did not have the time to manage their SEO well enough to compete in their market.
        - Combining their Search Engine Optimisation strategy with their social-media marketing strategy allowed us to succeed on the search engines whilst creating, scheduling and publishing content that felt totally natural to their exsisting followers and customers.

      title: Pay Per Click Management
      description:
        - Another part of Moonbabies marketing strategy was their pay per click campaign. We were able to help Moonbabies reduce their budget and increase their click through rate.
        - As part of an ongoing marketing campaign, we are happy to help with PPC (pay per click) campaigns. We have a good range of experience in this area and are always happy to help where we can.
